## Introduction
NIDC: General Task Backbone for Neuroimaging Based on Interpretable Deep Clustering</br>

## Usage (For the recognition task)</br>
1. **Data Preprocessing:**</br>
- After requesting the dataset, data preprocessing is performed using the open-source tools Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12), including skull stripping, tissue segmentation, and image registration.</br>

2. **Run:** </br>
- After generating the positional encoding template with 'BPE.py', run 'train.py'. (The code for the model module will be open-sourced during the manuscript revision process.)</br>

3. **Model:** </br>
